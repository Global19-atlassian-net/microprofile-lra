[[long-running-actions]]

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The proposal introduces annotations and APIs for services to coordinate
long running activities whilst still maintaining loose coupling and
doing so in such a way as to guarantee a globally consistent outcome
without the need to take locks on data.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

In a loosely coupled service based environment there is sometimes a need
for different services to provide consistency guarantees. Typical
examples include:

* order processing involving three services (take order, bill customer,
ship product). If the shipping service finds that it is out of stock
then the customer will have been billed with no prospect of receiving
his item.
* an airline overbooks a flight which means that the booking count and
the flight capacity are inconsistent.

There are various ways that systems overcome such inconsistency but it
would be advantageous to provide a generic solution which handles
failure conditions, maintains state for those flows that span long
periods of time and ensures that remedial activities are called
correctly.

Traditional techniques for guaranteeing consistency in distributed
environments has focused on XA transactions where locks may be held for
long periods thereby introducing strong coupling between services and
decreasing concurrency to unacceptable levels. Additionally, if such a
transaction aborts then valuable work which may be valid will be rolled
back. In view of these issues an alternative approach is desirable.

Goals

* support long running actions
* no strong coupling between services
* allow actions to finish early
* allow some parts of a computation to be cancelled without
  affecting other parts of the computation (aka nested activities)
* guarantee execution of compensating actions if a business activity
  is cancelled

[[proposed-solution]]
== The solution

We propose a compensation based approach in which participants make
changes visible but register a compensatory action which is performed if
something goes wrong. We call the model LRA (short for Long Running
Action) and is based on work done within the
https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ws-caf[OASIS
Web Services Composite Application Framework Technical Committee],
namely
https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=12794[Long
Running Action transaction model], but updated to be more suited for use
in microservice based architectures.

In the LRA model, an activity reflects business interactions: all work
performed within the scope of an activity is required to be
compensatable and the protocol ensures that when the activity terminates
then either all work will be accepted or will be compensated, ie
the activity’s work is either performed successfully or undone. For
example, when a user reserves a seat on a flight, the airline
reservation centre may take an optimistic approach and actually book the
seat and debit the user's account, relying on the fact that most of
their customers who reserve seats later book them; the compensation
action for this activity would be to un-book the seat and credit the
user’s account. How services perform their work and ensure it
can be undone if compensation is required are implementation choices and
is not exposed to the LRA model which simply defines the triggers for
compensation actions and the conditions under which those triggers are
executed. In other words, the LRA protocol is concerned only with
ensuring participants obey the protocol necessary to make an activity
compensatable and is intended to better model interactions between
microservices. Issues such as isolation of services between
potentially conflicting activities and durability of service work are
assumed to be implementation decisions. Although this may result in
non-atomic behaviour for the
overall business activity, other activities may be started by the
service to attempt to compensate in some other manner.

[[the-model]]
=== The Model

The model concerns participants (aka compensators), a logical coordinator
and a client. A client starts a new LRA via an annotation
or an API call which results in the creation of a new LRA.
When a business service does work that may have to be later compensated
it enlists a participant with the LRA which, when the client later closes
or cancels the LRA, operates on behalf of the service to undo the work
the service performed within the scope of an LRA or to compensate for the
fact that the original work could not be completed. The following diagram
shows the sequence of events that this model implies:

:imagesdir: images
.LRA Protocol Sequence
image::lra.png[align="center"]

The participants will be invoked in the following way when the LRA terminates:

* *Success*: the client has closed the LRA and the activity has completed
successfully. All participants (including ones enlisted with any LRAs nested
under the top level LRA) that are associated with the LRA
are informed that the activity has terminated and they can perform any
necessary cleanup.
* *Fail*: the client has cancelled the LRA and the activity has completed
unsuccessfully. All participants
that are registered with the LRA will be invoked to perform compensation
in the reverse order
footnote:[Note that calling participants in reverse order does not guarantee that
          the compensation actions will be performed in strict sequential order
          since participants are allowed to indicate that the compensation is in
          progress and will complete at some future time. Furthermore a
          participant can indicate that it failed to compensate, or could be
          unavailable in which case it will be periodically retried (out of
          order).].
The LRA forgets about all participants
that indicated they operated correctly. Otherwise, compensation may be
attempted again (possibly after a period of time) or alternatively a
compensation violation has occurred and must be logged. Each service is
required to log sufficient information in order to ensure (with best
effort) that compensation is possible even in the event of failures.

Interposition (nesting) and reliably storing the state of participants
allows the system to drive a consistent view of the outcome and to take
recovery actions in the event of failure, but allowing
always the possibility that recovery isn’t possible which must be logged
or flagged for the administrator and manual intervention may be necessary
to restore an application’s consistency.

A LRA and a participant both follow similar state models (with slightly
different wording to indicate that the states refer to the LRA as a whole
rather than to individual participants):

* `Active`: the LRA exists and has not been asked to close or cancel yet
* `Cancelling`: the LRA is currently being cancelled
* `Cancelled`: the LRA has successfully cancelled
* `FailedToCancel`: at least one participant was not able to
compensate
* `Closing`: the LRA is currently being closed
* `Closed`: the LRA has closed
* `FailedToClose`: at least one participant was not able to complete

:imagesdir: images
[[lra-state-model]]
.LRA State Model
image::lra-state-model.png[align="center" link="lra-state-model"]

And the participants state model has the following states:

* `Active`: the participant exists and has not been asked to compensate
or complete yet
* `Compensating`: a participant is currently compensating for the work
that it performed during the LRA.
* `Compensated`: a participant has successfully compensated for the work
that it performed during the LRA.
* `FailedToCompensate`: the participant was not able to compensate for the
work it did during the LRA.
* `Completing`: the participant is tidying up after being told to
complete.
* `Completed`: the participant has confirmed that it has finished
tidying up.
* `FailedToComplete`: the participant was unable to tidy-up some resources
it allocated during the LRA.

When a participant joins an LRA it is said to be enlisted but it does not
enter the state model until it receives a complete or compensate message:

:imagesdir: images
[[participant-state-model]]
.Participant State Model
image::participant-state-model.png[align="center" link="participant-state-model"]

The participant can be enlisted only once per LRA instance. When participant
is about to be enlisted multiple times (e.g. client calls the same `@LRA` method
several times) the follow-up enlistments of such participant MUST be ignored.

Different usage patterns for LRAs are possible, for example LRAs may be
used sequentially and/or concurrently, where the termination of one LRA
signals the start of some other unit of work within an application.
Additionally, speculative execution of work can be supported by nesting
LRAs, some of which can be cancelled independently of the parent LRA
whilst others are closed based on the outcome of other LRAs.
LRAs are units of compensatable work and an application may
have as many such units of work operating simultaneously as it needs to
accomplish its tasks. Furthermore, the outcome of work within LRAs may
determine how other LRAs are terminated. An application can be
structured so that LRAs are used to assemble units of compensatable work
and then held in the active state while the application performs other
work in the scope of different (concurrent or sequential) LRAs. Only
when the right subset of work (LRAs) is arrived at by the application
will that subset be confirmed; all other LRAs will be told to cancel
(complete in a failure state).

In the rest of this proposal we specify two different APIs for
controlling the life cycle of and participation in LRAs and a third API
for writing participants:

1.  <<java-annotations-for-lras,Java Annotations for LRAs>> for controlling
the life cycle and membership of LRAs
2.  <<java-based-lra-participant-registration-api,Java based LRA participant registration API>>
to support services that do not use JAX-RS

[[java-annotations-for-lras]]
=== Java Annotations for LRAs

Support for the proposal in MicroProfile is primarily based upon the use
of Java annotations for controlling the life cycle of LRAs and of participants, ie
the service developer annotates JAX-RS resources to specify how
LRAs should be controlled and when to _enlist a class_ as a participant.

==== Quick overview of annotations

The definitive documentation for how the annotations affect the behaviour of a running
program is the javadoc and this specification should be read in conjunction with it.
The annotations are defined in the
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation[org.eclipse.microprofile.lra.annotation]
package:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Annotation | Description

| https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/LRA.java#L30[@LRA]

  | Indicates that the method should be invoked if the LRA is cancelled.
| https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/Complete.java#L29[@Complete]
  | Indicates that the method should be invoked if the LRA is closed.
| https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/Forget.java#L29[@Forget]
  | Indicates that the method may release any resources that were allocated for this LRA.
| https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/Leave.java#L29[@Leave]
  | Indicates that this class is no longer interested in this LRA.
| https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/Status.java#L30[@Status]
  | When the annotated method is invoked it should report the status.
|===

Briefly, these annotations are used as follows:

The application annotates some JAX-RS resource method with `@LRA` which determines whether the
method will run in the context of an LRA. Generally, if a method starts a new LRA it will
be closed when the method finishes execution (but attributes of the annotation facilitate
full control over the LRA lifecycle).

If execution is to run with an active LRA and the associated class contains other methods
annotated with `@Compensate` and `@Complete` then these methods will be associated with
the active LRA. They will be invoked when the LRA is subsequently cancelled or closed.
If the participant successfully compensates or completes then it may forget about the LRA.
Otherwise it should remember that it is still associated with the LRA and it MUST report
the status of the association using values in the
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/ParticipantStatus.java[`ParticipantStatus`]
enum according to the participant state model defined earlier.
It can report the status directly from the `@Compensate` or `@Complete` methods if they
are idempotent, otherwise it MUST provide a method annotated with `@Status`.

If the participant is no longer associated with the LRA (because it has successfully
compensated or completed or because it has left the LRA) it MAY return the
`404 Not Found` HTTP status code from any of these methods.

If the participant knows it will never be able to compensate or complete then it MUST remember
that it could not until explicitly told that it can clean up by providing a method annotated with `@Forget`
(the requirement is marked MUST because message delivery is not guaranteed in a distributed system).

If multiple methods are annotated with the same annotation an arbitrary one will be chosen.

[[lra-context]]
==== The LRA Context

When a method is invoked in the context of an LRA its identifier MUST be made
available to the business logic. This LRA is referred to as the `active context`.
For JAX-RS resource methods the identifier is made available via request and
response headers which the business method can obtain using standard JAX-RS mechanisms,
ie `@Context` or by injecting a JAX-RS header param with the name specified by
the Java constant `LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER` as defined <<source-LRA, in the LRA annotation class>>.
This header is referred to as the `context header`.

The implementation MUST propagate the `active context` on outgoing JAX-RS
requests.
footnote:[issue #35 (Do not define JAX-RS annotations on `@Compensate` methods)
removes the requirement for some methods to be JAX-RS resources. The resolution
of that issue should ensure the context is still available to business logic.

If an LRA is propagated to a resource that is not annotated with any of the
annotations defined in this specification then the LRA will not be made
available to the invoked method. However, any outgoing JAX-RS invocations
made during the execution of the method will still carry the original context.

The user is allowed to manually assign the `context header` on JAX-RS requests
and responses:

===== Setting the context on outgoing JAX-RS requests

If the context is set on an outgoing JAX-RS request then it becomes the `active
context` for that invocation. When the invocation returns the context that
was active before the invocation once again becomes the active context.

===== Setting the context on JAX-RS responses

A resource is allowed to manually set the `context header` on JAX-RS responses.
Users should be careful when using this capability since this context will
overwrite whatever the implementation has set.

[[java-annotations]]
==== Starting and Ending LRAs

[[controlling-the-life-cycle-of-an-lra]]
The life cycle of an LRA is controlled via the <<source-LRA,LRA annotation>>
(https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/LRA.java#L30[@LRA]).

The annotation SHOULD be applied to JAX-RS annotated methods otherwise
it MAY have no effect. It determines whether or not the annotated method
will run in the context of an LRA and controls whether or not:

- any incoming context should be suspended and if so if a new one should be started.
- to start an new LRA.
- to end any LRA context when the method ends.
- to throw an exception if there should be an LRA present on method entry.
- to throw an exception if the method returns particular HTTP status codes.

If the method is to run in the context of an LRA and the annotated class
also contains methods annotated with `@Compensate` and `@Complete` then the bean
(aka participant or compensator) will be enlisted with the LRA. Enlisting with
an LRA means that the bean will be notified when the current LRA is
subsequently cancelled or closed. In addition the implementation should generate a
URI for this participant that can be used
for recovery purposes and it should make it available to the participant via a JAX-RS
header param with name defined by the Java constant `LRA_HTTP_RECOVERY_HEADER` as defined
<<source-LRA, in the LRA annotation>>
(https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/LRA.java[github link]).
Enlisting in an LRA is explained in more detail
<<compensating-activities,in a later section>> of this document.

It is the `LRA.Type` element that provides fine grained control over the
LRA for the duration of the execution of the annotated method:

The possible values of the `LRA.Type` element are defined in the javadoc
provided in the quick overview links above but are worth repeating here:

`LRA.Type.REQUIRED`::
    If called outside an LRA context a new LRA will be created for the
    the duration of the method call and when the call completes it will
    be closed. +
     +
    If called inside an LRA context the invoked method will run with the
    same context and the context will remain active after the method
    completes.

`LRA.Type.REQUIRES_NEW`::
    If called outside an LRA context a new LRA will be created for the
    the duration of the method call and when the call completes it will
    be terminated (closed or cancelled). +
     +
    If called inside an LRA context it will be suspended and a new LRA
    context will be created for the duration of the call. When the method
    finishes this new LRA will be terminated (closed or cancelled) and
    the original context will be resumed. +
     +
    But note that if there was already a context active before the method
    was invoked and the `LRA#end()` attribute is set to false
    then the new LRA is left active. In this case the original LRA will
    remain suspended (until the new LRA finishes) unless the `LRA#end()`
    attribute was also set to true in which case the original LRA context
    will be closed/cancelled.

`LRA.Type.MANDATORY`::
    If called outside a transaction context, the method call will return
    with a `412 Precondition Failed` HTTP status code +
     +
    If called inside a transaction context the bean method execution will
    then continue within that context.

`LRA.Type.SUPPORTS`::
    If called outside an LRA context the bean method execution
    must then continue outside an LRA context. +
     +
    If called inside an LRA context the managed bean method execution
    must then continue inside this LRA context.

`LRA.Type.NOT_SUPPORTED`::
    The bean method is executed without an LRA context. If a context is
    present on entry then it is suspended and then resumed after the
    execution has completed.

`LRA.Type.NEVER`::
    If called outside an LRA context the managed bean method execution
    must then continue outside an LRA context. +
     +
    If called inside an LRA context the method is not executed and a
    <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> HTTP status code is returned
    to the caller.

This default life cycle behaviour is affected by the values of the other
attributes of the LRA:

`LRA.Type#REQUIRED` and `LRA.Type#REQUIRES_NEW` can start
new LRAs which by default will be closed when the annotated method
completes. This default behaviour can be overridden using the
`LRA#end()` attribute which will leave the new LRA active
when the method completes.

In normal circumstances the LRA is closed by the end of the method.
To force the LRA to cancel instead to close
use the `LRA#cancelOnFamily()` or `LRA#cancelOn()` attributes.
These attributes defines families or/and sets of status codes
which when returned as the
https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.html#status-int-[Response status code]
cause the LRA to be cancelled.

Bear in mind that the LRA is expected to be used with JAX-RS
which expects the `Response` being the method return type.
If a `200 OK` response is to be returned then the method can
return any data type that it desires.
The specification does not discuss what happens when
an uncaught exception is thrown from the `@LRA` annotated method.
It's up to the framework to transform the thrown exception
to the JAX-RS `Response` error status code.
It's a usual practice the `RuntimeException` to be transformed
to the `5xx` `Response` status code.

If an LRA was already present before the annotated method is invoked then it
will remain active after the method completes. This default behaviour
can be overridden using the `LRA#end()` attribute which will force
the LRA to be finished. If it is closed or cancelled depends on the Response status return code.

When an LRA is present its identifier MUST be made available to
the business logic via request and response headers as described earlier
(using a header name specified in the Java constant `LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER`).

The following is a simple example of how to start an LRA and how to receive
a notification when the LRA is later cancelled (`@Compensate` is invoked)
or closed (`@Complete` is invoked):

[source,java]
----
@Path("/")
@ApplicationScoped
public class SimpleLRAParticipant
{
    @Path("/cdi")
    @LRA(LRA.Type.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void doInTransaction(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId)
    {
        /*
         * Perform business actions in the context of the LRA identified by the
         * value in the injected JAX-RS header. This LRA was started just before
         * the method was entered (REQUIRES_NEW) and will be closed when the
         * method finishes at which point the completeWork method below will be
         * invoked.
         */
    }

    @PUT
    @Path("/complete")
    @Complete
    public Response completeWork(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId,
                                 String userData)
    {
        /*
         * Free up resources allocated in the context of the LRA identified by the
         * value in the injected JAX-RS header.
         *
         * Since there is no @Status method in this class completeWork MUST be
         * idempotent and MUST return the status.
         */
         return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Completed.name()).build();
    }

    @PUT
    @Path("/compensate")
    @Compensate
    public Response compensateWork(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId,
                                   String userData)
    {
        /*
         * The LRA identified by the value in the injected JAX-RS header was
         * cancelled so the business logic should compensate for any actions
         * that have been performed while running in its context.
         *
         * Since there is no @Status method in this class compensateWork MUST be
         * idempotent and MUST return the status
         */
         return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Compensated.name()).build();
    }

    @DELETE
    @Path("/forget")
    @Forget
    public Response forgetWork(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId)
    {
        // clean up any resources that were used in the context of lraId
    }
}
----

The example also shows that when an LRA is present its identifier can be obtained
by reading the request and response headers.

The next example demonstrates how to start an LRA in one method and close
it in a different method using the `end` attribute.
It also shows how to configure the LRA to be automatically cancelled if the business method
returns the particular HTTP status codes identified in the `cancelOn` and
`cancelOnFamily` attributes:

[source,java]
----
  @POST
  @Path("/book")
  @LRA(value = LRA.Type.REQUIRED,
       cancelOn = {
           Response.Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR // cancel on a 500 code
       },
       cancelOnFamily = {
           Response.Status.Family.CLIENT_ERROR // cancel on any 4xx code
       },
       end = false) // the LRA will continue to run when the method finishes
  public Response bookTrip(...) { ... }

  @PUT
  @Path("/confirm")
  @LRA(LRA.Type.SUPPORTS,
       end = true) // end the LRA started by the bookTrip method
  public Booking confirmTrip(Booking booking) throws BookingException { ... }
----

The `end = false` attribute on the bookTrip method forces the LRA to continue running when
the method finishes and the `end = true` attribute on the confirmTrip method forces the LRA
(started by the bookTrip method) to close the LRA.

[[compensating-activities]]
==== Compensating Activities

The application developer indicates which JAX-RS method to use for a compensating
activity by annotating it with both the `@Compensate` and the JAX-RS `@PUT` annotations.
Whenever the associated resource is invoked in the context of
an LRA the endpoint corresponding to the `@Compensate` method MUST be enlisted with
the LRA. If the LRA is subsequently cancelled then the compensation method MUST be invoked.
For example:

[source,java]
----
  @PUT
  @Path("/compensate")
  @Compensate
  public Response compensateWork(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId)
  {
    // compensate for whatever activity the business logic has associated with lraId
    return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Compensated.name()).build();
  }
----

The resource class MAY also contain a method marked with the `@Complete` and the
JAX-RS `@PUT` annotations. If such a method is present then the method MUST
be invoked when the associated LRA is closed.
Typically the resource would use this call to perform any clean up actions. The
method is optional since such clean up actions may not be necessary, for example
consider an online store that takes provisional bookings which are automatically
timed out if not confirmed within a predefined period.

If the participant successfully compensates or completes then it may forget about
the LRA. Otherwise it should remember that it is still associated with the LRA and
it MUST report the status of the association using one of the values in the
`ParticipantStatus` enum according to to the <<participant-state-model,the
participant state model>>. If the compensation and completion methods are not
idempotent then there MUST be a method annotated with `@Status` which reports the
status. Otherwise the compensation and completion methods should return the status.
If the participant is no longer associated with the LRA (because it has successfully
compensated/completed) it MAY return the `404 Not Found` HTTP status code from any
of these methods. If it knows it will never be able to compensate or complete then
it MUST remember the fact until explicitly told that it can clean up by providing
a method annotated with `@Forget` (the requirement is marked MUST because message
delivery is not guaranteed in a distributed system).
The forget method MUST be annotated with the JAX-RS `@DELETE` annotation.

If there is no `@Status` then the `@Compensate` or `@Complete` methods will continue
to be invoked until the implementation knows it has the final status.

If the resource cannot perform a compensation activity
immediately the `@Compensate` method SHOULD do one or more of the following:

- return `ParticipantStatus.Compensating`
- return a `202 Accepted` HTTP status code
- mark the method as a JAX-RS asynchronous method (using the
  `javax.ws.rs.container.Suspended` annotation).

The `@Status` method, if present, MUST report the progress of the compensation.

Similarly if it cannot perform a completion activity immediately.

If the `@Compensate` or `@Complete` annotation is present on multiple methods
then an arbitrary one is chosen. If the annotation is not accompanied by
a JAX-RS `@PUT` annotation the error SHOULD be reported using a JAX-RS
exception mapper that maps to a `412 Precondition Failed` HTTP status code.

footnote:[issue #15 (Provide an annotation to supply opaque data during
participant registration) allows participants to register opaque data when
joining with an LRA. This data is made available to the completion and
compensation callbacks]

The javadoc for the <<source-Compensate,Compensate annotation>> provides
more details about this annotation. 

Similarly, the javadoc for the <<source-Complete,Complete annotation>>
provides details about the `@Complete` annotation. 

[[nesting-lras]]
==== Nesting LRAs

An activity can be scoped within an existing LRA using the `@NestedLRA`
annotation. Invoking a method marked with this annotation will start a
new LRA whose outcome depends upon whether the enclosing LRA is closed
or cancelled.

* If the nested LRA is closed but the outer LRA is cancelled then the
participants registered with the nested LRA will be told to compensate.
* If the nested LRA is cancelled the outer LRA can be still closed.

In the following example the bookFlight method supports the presence of
an LRA context and if there is one present then it books a flight inside a
nested LRA which means that it can be cancelled independently of the parent
LRA. But if there is no LRA present then a new top level LRA is started
for the duration of the bookFlight method. See the <<use-cases,use cases>>
section for when this feature could be useful.

[source,java]
----
    @Inject
    private FlightService service;

    @POST
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @LRA(LRA.Type.SUPPORTS)
    @NestedLRA
    public Booking bookFlight(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId,
                              @QueryParam("flightNumber") String flightNumber) {
        return service.book(lraId, flightNumber);
    }
----

Note that the mechanics of cancelling nested and top level LRAs is the same.

[[timing-out-lras-and-compensators]]
==== Timing out LRAs and Participants

The business logic may wish to control how long an LRA should remain active
for before it becomes eligible for automatic cancellation by providing values
for the `timeLimit` and `timeUnit` attributes of the `@LRA` annotation. For
example, to indicate that an LRA should automatically cancel after 100 milliseconds:

[source,java]
----
  @GET
  @Path("/doitASAP")
  @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
  @LRA(value = LRA.Type.REQUIRED, timeLimit = 100, timeUnit = ChronoUnit.MILLIS)
  public Response theClockIsTicking(
      @HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId) {...}
----

Furthermore, the ability to compensate or complete may be transient capabilities of a
service so participants can also be timed out. When the time limit is reached
the LRA is cancelled and participants will be notified via their compensation
(i.e. the method annotated with `@Compensate`). To set such a time limit add the
`timeLimit` and `timeUnit` attributes to the `@Compensate` and `@Complete`
annotations. If different time limits are set on these two methods then the
earliest of the two will take effect. An example of how a participant could
indicate that its' ability to compensate is limited to 100 milliseconds could be:

[source,java]
----
    @PUT
    @Path("/compensate")
    @Compensate(timeLimit = 100, timeUnit = ChronoUnit.MILLIS)
    public Response completeWork(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId,
                                 String userData) { ... }
----

In this example after 100 milliseconds has passed the implementation SHOULD
automatically cancel the LRA which will result in this method being invoked.

[[leaving-an-lra]]
==== Leaving an LRA

If a resource method annotated with @Leave is invoked in the context of an
LRA and if the bean class has registered a participant with the active LRA
it will be removed from the LRA just before the bean method is entered
(and will not be asked to complete or compensate when the LRA is
subsequently ended). Even though the method runs without an LRA context
the implementation MUST still make the context available via a JAX-RS header.

The javadoc for the <<source-Leave,Leave annotation>> provides greater detail
about this annotation. 

An example of this annotation is shown next:

[source,java]
----
    @PUT
    @Path("/leave")
    @Leave
    public Response leaveWork(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId) {
      // clean up since this participant is no longer associated with the LRA
    }
----

[[reporting-the-status-of-a-participant]]
==== Reporting the status of a participant

This specification supports distributed communications amongst services and
due to the unreliable nature of networks messages/requests can be lost, delayed,
duplicated etc and the implementation component responsible for invoking
participant completion/compensation logic may loose track of the status of
a participant. In this case, ideally it would just resend the
completion or compensation notification but if the participant does not
support idempotency then it MUST be able to report its status by
annotating one of the methods with the `@Status` annotation which should
report the status according to the
<<participant-state-model,participant state model>> by returning one of the
<<source-ParticipantStatus,ParticipantStatus enum values>>
(https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/ParticipantStatus.java[github link]).

If the participant has already responded successfully to an `@Compensate`
or `@Complete` method invocation then it MAY report `404 Not Found`
HTTP status code. This enables the participant to free up resources.

If this status method is invoked before either of the `@Compensate` or
`@Complete` methods have been called then the participant should report
that it does not yet have a status using a JAX-RS exception mapper that
maps to a `412 Precondition Failed` HTTP status code (such as
<<source-IllegalLRAStateException,IllegalLRAStateException>>)
(https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/client/IllegalLRAStateException.java[github link]).

[[forgetting-an-lra]]
==== Forgetting an LRA

If a participant is unable to complete or compensate immediately
(i.e. it has indicated that the request has been accepted and is
in progress) or because of a failure (i.e. will never be able to finish)
then it must remember the fact (by reporting its' status via the
`@Status` method) until explicitly told that it can clean up
using this `@Forget` annotation. The forget annotation must be a
standard JAX-RS endpoint annotated with the JAX-RS `@DELETE` annotation.

This requirement ensures that the implementation will be able to guarantee
the expectations of the LRA protocol under various failure conditions.
Only when the implementation is certain that participant has finished
will it tell it that it is okay to release any resources it associated
with the LRA.

[[failure-resilience]]
==== Recovery Requirements

This LRA specification provides guarantees of Atomicity, Consistency and Durability
of work which places responsibilities on both spec implementers and application
writers. Failure points include loss of contact with components managing the
life cycle of LRAs and of participants. Application writers need to know
how to associate work with an LRA context so that the correct work
can be compensated for even after JVM or node crashes.
Likewise infrastructure components may become unavailable and state must
survive system failures. The specification is not prescriptive about how
an implementation achieves resiliency provided that it obeys the requirements
of the specification as laid out in this document.

[[java-based-lra-participant-registration-api]]
=== Java based LRA participant registration API

If an application does not directly expose JAX-RS endpoints for
compensation activities then participants can join an LRA directly using an instance of
<<source-LRAManagement,LRAManagement>>
(https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/participant[github link]).
This interface requires that a participant be a Java class conforming to the
<<source-LRAParticipant,LRAParticipant interface>>
(https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/participant[github link]).

When an LRA is closed or cancelled the implementation [of this specification] is responsible
for invoking LRAParticipant completion or compensation
callbacks on any participants that were registered via the `LRAManagement#joinLRA` method.

How the application obtains an LRAManagement instance is unspecified
(but CDI injection could be an obvious choice). For example, the following code listing
shows how to inject instances of the API and how to perform work in the context of an LRA:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/")
public class UnannotatedParticpant implements LRAParticipant {
    @Inject
    private LRAManagement lraManagement;

    public void doInTransaction() throws JoinLRAException
    {
        // start a new LRA with an unlimited timeout
        // by invoking a suitable JAX-RS resource method annotated
        // with @LRA(value = LRA.Type.REQUIRES_NEW, end = false)
        ...

        // Join the LRA as a participant.
        lraManagement.joinLRA(this, lraId, 0L, ChronoUnit.SECONDS);

        // do something interesting

        // close the LRA by invoking a suitable JAX-RS resource method
        // annotated with, for example,
        //  @LRA(value = LRA.Type.SUPPORTS, end = true)
        // This will cause the completion call back to be invoked
        ...

        // the completeWork method will have been invoked at this point
    }

    // the callback that will be invoked if the LRA is closed
    @Override
    public Future<Void> completeWork(URI lraId)
        throws NotFoundException, TerminationException
    {
        return null;
    }

    // the callback that will be invoked if the LRA is cancelled
    @Override
    public Future<Void> compensateWork(URI lraId)
        throws NotFoundException, TerminationException
    {
        return null;
    }
}
----

The framework must guarantee that participants will still be triggered (the LRA protocol still provides the "all or
nothing" guarantees that traditional transactions give).
This means that an implementation for all JAX-RS resources which implement the _LRAParticipant_ interface directly
or indirectly, MUST create some proxy which can be called by the coordinator. +
This to ensure that after this class has joined an LRA (through the _lraManagement.joinLRA()_ ) the _complete_ or
_compensate_ methods can be called by the coordinator in case the microservice crashed before this notification could
be delivered.

Serializable participants need to know how to contact the original
business application in order to trigger compensation activities whereas
a JAX-RS based solution need only persist resource paths which are likely
to correspond to existing microservice endpoints. In other words, from
an administrative and manageability point of view, it may be simpler to
use one of the other APIs such as the <<java-annotations-for-lras,Java
Annotations for LRAs>>.
